# Jmeter Performance Testing

## Project Summary: 
This project demonstrates performance testing using Apache JMeter. The tests were designed to assess the throughput and performance of API:

Booking API: Simulates user interactions for creating and searching bookings. The project includes both load and stress tests.

Load Testing: Test how a system can behave under an expected load.
	  
Stress Testing: Test how a system behave if gradually increase the load.


    

## Technologies I have used:

- Apache JMeter
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)



## How to run?

1.	Clone the Repository
2.	Install Apache Jmeter
3.	Open Jmeter
4.	Run the Load Test and the Stress Test (for booking API)
   
           a. Select the booking.jmx or dmoney.jmx script in JMeter.
           b. Click the green Start button at the top to begin running the load test.
           c. Monitor the test progress in the View Results Tree and Summary Report listeners.
